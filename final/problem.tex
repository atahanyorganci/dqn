\section{Problem Description}
The problem that we have is the utilization of deep reinforcement learning, with the specific model of convolutional neural networks, trained with Deep Q-Learning, whose input is raw pixel values, varying between \( \{0, 1, \dots, 255\} \), of a grayscale version of the image of the current state, and output is the most suitable action from the action space. The question that we would like to address is whether the trained agent can outperform a random agent, which takes random actions at each time step, and if so whether it can outperform a human agent that plays the game in the same settings.
