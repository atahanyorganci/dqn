## Developed Model

[Best model developed](artifacts/dqn_rew28-det-v4.chkpt) is able achieve 28 reward points in a deterministic environment. The model used is based on famous DQN article published in [Nautre by Google DeepMind](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236), and is trained on Atari Breakout [gym environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Breakout-v0/), and is implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
